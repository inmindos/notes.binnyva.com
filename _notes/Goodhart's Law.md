> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Metrics and KPI should not become the targets. This will lead to unwanted behavior or system gaming. Find things that measure the value - rather than just things that can be easily counted. Have different [[SMART Goals|goals]].

Eg. Exams were made as a measure for learning - now it is anything but.
