Exaggerated irrational thinking that can lead to anxiety/depression - or continue the state of anxiety/depression. This causes people to have a wrong idea about reality - often a negative one. It reinforces negative thoughts and emotions. Part of the [[CBT]] model.

- **Black or white thinking**: Everything is good or bad - no in-between. 
- **Over generalization**: Creating sweeping generalizations from one event. Eg. I failed this exam, so I'm a bad student.
- **Cognitive Filtering**: Only looking at the negative aspects of something.
- **Disqualifying the good**: Finding rational to ignore and minimize the good things. Eg. "Anyone could have done that."
- **Jumping to conclusions**: Coming to conclusions with very little data.
	- **Mind Reading**: Guessing others thoughts/mental state - usually in a negative light for oneself.
	- **Fortune telling**: Predicting (usually bad) outcomes
- **Emotional Reasoning**: I feel this, so it must be true
- **Rigid Rule Keeping**: Have a list of shoulds and musts that can't be broken.
- **Catastrophising / Worst case scenario-ing**: Imagining/preparing for the worst case scenario.
- **Labeling/Self Labeling**: Close to Generalization. Labeling oneself or others based on a single event.
