# "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World" 
by [[Cal Newport - So Good They Can't Ignore You]]

["Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World" by Cal Newport - BOOK SUMMARY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RMtnDaxmPw)

Two types of work...

### Shallow Work
Only requires little time and focus. Eg. Answering emails

- Low value
- Commodatized
- Most people can do it.

### Deep-work
When you lock yourself in a room for 5 hours without distractions.

- Creates value
- Improves skill. 

Bill Gates had "think weeks" - where he isolated himself to read and think.

The more you do shallow work, the less you can do deep work. Our attention is fragmented thanks to a lot of things.
We think busy is productive.

Actively train our-self to put focused, UN-interupted work at the core of what we do. Options...
- Disconnect for a week once or twice a year
- Limiting access to social media
- Allocating a window to do deep work
