Comfort can ruin you. Growth happens in discomfort.

There are four stages you can be in...

- stagnation - nothing new happens to you, you are at a constant state.
- order - things are changing in a predictable way
- complexity - Things are out of order. Outcome can't be predicted reliably. This is the ideal stage for growth
- chaos - nothing can be predicted
