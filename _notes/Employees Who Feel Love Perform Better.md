Compassionate love is based on warmth, affection, and connection rather than passion. Those who perceive greater affection and caring from their colleagues perform better, but few managers focus on building an emotional culture

## Ways to build an emotional culture of compassionate love.

1. broaden your definition of culture. Instead of focusing on “cognitive culture” — values such as teamwork, results-orientation, or innovation — you might think about how you can cultivate and enrich emotional culture as well.  Emotional culture can be based on love or other emotions, such as joy or pride.
2. pay attention to the emotions you’re expressing to employees every day.  Your mood creates a cultural blueprint for the group.
3. consider how your company policies and practices can foster greater affection, caring, compassion, and tenderness among workers.
