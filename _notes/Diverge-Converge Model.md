Use this to create many options - and then pick one option.

The meeting should start with a goal. Then people can create multiple options that can be used to meet the goal. This is the Diverge part. Brainstorming methods can be used here. 

Once we have a list of options, we converge to chose one(or few) options. This is the Converge part. You can use any of the [[Option Selection Strategies]] to do this.

Once the option is selected, make sure you have a action as the Next Step / What next for the meeting.
