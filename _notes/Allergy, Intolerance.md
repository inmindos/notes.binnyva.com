Allergy, Intolerance & Sensitivity are distinct things, with different mechanisms
- Allergy is caused by an immune response
- Intolerance is caused by a digestive issue, potentially following a stomach flu or some damage to the intestine
- Sensitivity is not well defined, it's more a marketing term
