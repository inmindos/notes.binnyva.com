- Find common ground. Let the other party "win" at times
- Present few, strong arguments rather than a lot of arguments. If you give many arguments, the other party will discredit the weak ones - leading them to discredit the entire argument(Strawman fallacy)
- Think like a scientist - be curious about the other parties arguments. Ask questions to understand their arguments
