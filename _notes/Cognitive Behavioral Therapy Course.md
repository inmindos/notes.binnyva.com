### Founding Assumptions

- No bad intentions
	- Accept without judgment
- Past != Future
- No one is broken
- Everything is possible
- Empowerment via responsibility

### Factors that impede or ability to listen/learn

- External factors
	- and mental situation
- Response Rehearsal
- Fact finding
- Being Judgmental
- Problem Solving
- Imposing Personal View

Identity labels: We are meaning making machines. We will assign labels or meanings to events - that will affect the way we process it.

Situation -> Thoughts -> Emotions -> Behavior -> Outcome -> Thoughts -> ...

### ABC of CBT

- Events(Activating event/trigger)
	- World
	- Other People
	- Experiences
	- Personal History
	- Future
- Thoughts(Beliefs)
	- Attitudes
	- Rules
	- Beliefs
	- World Views
	- Opinions
- Emotions (Consequences)
	- Good
	- Bad
	- Useful
	- Un-useful
- Behaviors (Consequences)
	- Constructive
	- Destructive

[[Map vs Territory|Map is not the territory]]. Means - Perception is not reality

### Mental Filter

Before we store an event in our memory, it goes thru many filters. So the final memory is very different from the actual event. The filters are...

- Deletions
- Distortions
- Generalizations
- Personalisations

### CBT Standard

- Therapist
	- Available
	- Self Aware
	- Attentive
- Client
	- Open
	- Receptive
	- Appreciative
		
### Cognitive Distortions

Commonly found wrong beliefs - or pattern of thinking.

- Black or white thinking
- Over generalization
- Cognitive Filtering
- Disqualifying the good
- Jumping to conclusions
- Emotional Reasoning
- Rigid Rule Keeping
- Catastrophising / Worst case scenario-ing
- Labeling/Self Labeling

### Thought-Feeling Link

Activating Event/Trigger -> Belief(Assigned Meaning) -> Consequential Outcome(Response)

Using B-C connections can help us identify our beliefs. If we know what our emotional reactions are, we can identify what types of beliefs we may have, e.g., sadness = loss; anxiety = future threat; anger = violation of our rights.

Free will is a muscle that requires exercise. If you don't exercise it often, you'll be swept along by emotional responses. Be aware of your emotions - learn to notice when they change

### Thought Policing

When you get a thought that is affecting your emotions...

- What are the evidences for that thought
- What are the evidences against that thought
	- Decided based on that if its a valid thought or not.

#### Thought Review Process

- What happened?(The situation)
- What emotion did you feel?(Rate from 1-10 - 1 being worst.)
- What were the physical sensations?
- What did you think about/focus on?
- What is a more useful perspective?
- How will you prevent this happening again?

1. The situation
2. What was the initial thought
3. Consider the consequences
4. Challenge your initial thought
5. (Optional) What are the cognitive distortions in effect.
6. Background(Optional) - when did you first have thoughts like this? How deep is it in you?
7. Alternative thinking?
8. Positive belief and affirmation
9. Action plan
10. Improvement.

### Locus of Control

Locus of Control considers the tendency of people to believe that control resides internally within them, or externally, with others or the situation.

- The World - Least control
	- Religion
	- World Peace
	- Weather
	- Politics
- Environment
	- Friends
	- Family
	- Work
	- Society
- Me - Most control
	- Body
	- Attitude
	- Choices

THe Lazarus Technique: Focus and leverage - get the client to tell us the problem in just one word or one phrase.

Technique to control extreme emotion: Focus on the extreme emotion you are having - and just drop down thru it. 

### Emotional Time Travel

The emotions associated with mental time travel...

- Past
	- Good
	- Bad
	- Happy
	- Sad
- Future
	- Fear
	- Faith
	- Excitement
	- Anxiety

### Commonly held wrong beliefs

The following stated beliefs are from Albert Ellis(he made Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy). This has some similarities to the TA Drivers

- "I must do well and get the approval of everybody who matters to me or I will be a worthless person."
- "Other people must treat me kindly and how I want them to treat me or else they are bad."
- "I must have an easy, enjoyable life (without responsibilities) or I cannot enjoy living at all."
- "All the people who matter to me must love me and approve of everything that I say and do."
- "I must be a high achiever and succeed at everything I do, or I will be worthless."
- "Nobody should ever behave badly and if they do, they must be condemned."
- "I mustn't ever get angry or frustrated, and if I do, I am a bad person."
- "When things are tough and I am under pressure, I must be sad and there's nothing I can do about this."
- "When faced with the possibility of something unsafe or dangerous happening to me, I must obsess about it and make frantic efforts to avoid it."
- "I can avoid my responsibilities and dealing with life's difficulties and still be fulfilled."
- "My past is the most important part of my life and it will keep on dictating how I feel and what I do."
- "Everybody and everything should be better than they are and, if they're not, it's a bad thing."
- "I deserve to be happy by doing as little as possible and by just enjoying myself in life."

### Mistaken Beliefs Workbook

Use these questions to identify mistaken beliefs.

1. What is the evidence that supports this belief? If I look objectively at all of my life experiences, what is the evidence that this belief is true?
2. Is this belief always true for me?
3. Does this belief consider the whole picture? Does it take into consideration both the positive and negative ramifications?
4. Does this belief encourage my own peace of mind and well-being?
5. Did I choose this belief or has it developed from the influence of my family/friends as I was growing up?

Remember that whatever value these mistaken beliefs may have offered you in the past, they no longer offer you and only serve to create stress and anxiety for you now.

### Stages of Belief Development

| Age   | State               | State       |
|:------|:--------------------|:------------|
| 0-7   | Imprinting Stage    | Unconscious |
| 7-14  | Modelling Stage     | Unconscious |
| 14-21 | Socialization Stage | Unconscious |
| 21+   | Active Learning     | Conscious   |

### Pavlov’s 5 Major Conditioning Processes

1. Acquisition: Is the initial learning that takes place. It is determined by how much time elapses between the presenting the neutral stimuli (NS) and the unconditioned stimuli (UCS).
2. Extinction: Is how long it takes to forget or eliminate the conditioned response (CR).
3. Spontaneous Recovery: Happens after the conditioned response (CR) reappears after a long period of time. It proved that Extinction only suppressed the conditioned response (CR), not completely eliminated it.
4. Generalisation: Is the tendency to respond to stimuli that is similar to the conditioned stimuli (CS). For example Pavlov’s dog would drool upon hearing a buzzer as well as the bell.
5. Discrimination: Is the learned ability to differentiate between similar stimuli (the dog learns eventually to tell the difference between the bell and the buzzer).

Feedback mechanisms...

- Positive Reinforcement
- Negative Reinforcement
- Negative Punishment
- Positive Punishment

#### Bridging The Gap Between Sessions

These questions can be used to jog both yours and your clients memory of the last session

1. What main points did we reach in our last session? What did you learn from the last session? Did anything come to mind in the past week about our previous session that you’d like me to know or that you’d like to discuss?
2. Were you uncomfortable about anything we talked about in our last session? Is there anything you wish we had discussed that we didn’t?
3. How is your mood? (How is your physical health?) Compared with last week, is it better or worse?
4. What specific goals would you like to work on today? What problems would you like to put on the agenda?
5. What homework did you attempt or complete after the last session? What did you learn from doing it?
