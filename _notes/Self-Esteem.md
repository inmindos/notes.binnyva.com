While [[Self-concept]] is the belief of who we are(eg. I am introverted), Self-esteem is the value we attach to such a belief(eg. I hate that I am introverted).

> "The self-concept is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it"

Abraham Maslow included self-esteem in his famous "[[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]". It has two forms of "esteem"...

- From other in form of respect, recognition or admiration
- From yourself in the form of self-confidence, self-worth: self-esteem.

If you are curious to understand how much self esteem you have, there are tests that can measure it - like Rosenberg self-esteem scale.
