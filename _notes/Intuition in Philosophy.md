Intuition in philosophy is "an indirect way to grasp knowledge and morality". You intuitively know if an action is right or wrong - even though you can't work out why.

Intuition is, basically, [[Thinking Fast and Slow|system 1 thinking]].

Even though Intuition is a decent test of ideas, it can be wrong too. Something that people thought is intuitively correct can turn out to be wrong when analyzed properly. Also, different people can have different Intuitions about the same thing.

- Defend the counter intuitive theory on the basis of theoretical virtues.
- Train ourselves to have better intuitions in similar situations.
