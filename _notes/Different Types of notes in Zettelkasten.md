Types of notes in [[Zettelkasten]]

## Fleeting notes
They are simple reminders of information or ideas that will need to be processed later on, or trashed.

## Literature notes 
Brief annotations on a particular source (e.g. book, website or paper), that youâ€™d like to access later on. 

## Concept notes/Permanent Notes
This require much more care in authoring: they need to be self-explanatory and detailed. You'll have to paraphrase the source material to create this. [[Capture Understanding - Don't Quote]]
