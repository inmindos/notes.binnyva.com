The study of how many smaller systems(components) interacting with each other and their environment can create a bigger system without the need for an centralized authority or external interventions([[System Self Organization]]). The super system that is built might not be predictable by knowing all the smaller systems. You'll have to see the parts, the connections - and also how these connections result in a new system. The creation of new behaviors and properties like this is called emergence.

Simple System's function can be predicted by understanding all its components. Complex Systems, not so much.
