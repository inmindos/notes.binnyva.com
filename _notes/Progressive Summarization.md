Progressive Summarization is a technique that relies on summarizing a note in multiple stages over time. You save only the best excerpts from whatever youâ€™re reading, and then create a summary of those excerpts, and then a summary of that summary, distilling the essence of the content at each stage.

Can be used in [[Zettelkasten]] note creation process.
