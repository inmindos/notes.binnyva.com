Different theories of how one person is themselves over time...

- Body theory: Bodily continuity. As long as the person is in the same body, its the same person. Problems with this theory: Ship of Theseus(we are constantly changing), Teleportation problem.
- Memory Theory: as long as you can remember a previous version of you, and that version would have remembered an even older version of you, creating a chain as long as your life. Problems: we don't have memory as children, missing memory, etc.
- Survival Theory: Who I am are the parts that survived till now. If a memory is forgotten, that's no longer part of me.

The Psychology of [[Identity]] will go int [[Social identity theory]] and [[Self-Concept]].
