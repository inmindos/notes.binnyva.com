There are 2 frameworks we can use when brainstorming...

## DOVE

- Deffer Judgment
- Off-beat ideas
- Vast quantities of ideas
- Elaboration/expansion of ideas

## ROPE

- Record all ideas
- Original ideas are encouraged (no stupid ideas)
- Put off evaluation (judgment can be done later)
- Expand on otherâ€™s ideas
