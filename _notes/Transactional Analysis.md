> "Method of therapy that analyses transactions by understanding what state of mind they are in when communicating - and how those states of mind came to be."

Developed by Eric Berne in the 1950s.

TA is a theory of personality and a systematic psychotherapy for personal growth and change. It provides a theory of communication, how people communicate and why communications break down. It offers a theory of child development - how decisions made in childhood may continue to influence behavior later in life despite painful consequences. Who you were at 7 years old still controls you. Micro/Macro wounds at that stage still influences us.

The Goal of TA is **Autonomy - or Freedom from the [[TA - Life Script|life script]]**. This involves...

### Awareness

- Ability to stay in here and now
- External Awareness: Sensory inputs without judging
- Internal Awareness: Thoughts, feelings, sensations

### Spontaneity

The ability to freely choose between any of the 3 [[TA - Ego States|ego states]] as appropriate to the situation

### Intimacy

The ability to [[TA - Time Structuring|authentically]] communicate feels with mutual OK-ness
