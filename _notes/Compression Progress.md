Humans have a natural curiosity - its a drive to learn patterns, rules, heuristic that lets you compress your understanding into something that's easier to remember. If you encounter **a new rule that can better compress knowledge than the earlier one, that is 'compression progress'**. Brain will use the better rule from then onward. We learn many such rules as children - but we refine them as we grow older. Brain rewards us with a good feeling or 'Aha moments' when we find a better rule.
