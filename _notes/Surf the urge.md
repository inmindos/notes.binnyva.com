Surfing the Urge is a practice to increase your Distress Tolerance(Ability to be in control when things go wrong). This is the process

1. Notice the thought, craving or feeling
2. Accept and attend to the inner experience
3. Breath and give your brain and body a chance to pause and plan.
4. Broaden your attention and look for the action that will help you archive your goal.

Very useful for [[Willpower Challenge]].
