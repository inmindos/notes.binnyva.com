Create a custom productivity system that works for you. Keep updating that as needed. 

- **Identify bottlenecks**. Ask yourself: what are my challenges? What is getting in the way of achieving my goals?
- **Make time for reflection**. This could be event level(when you find yourself procrastinating, ask yourself why), journaling, some review mechanism, or pair/group chats.
- **Be Mindful of your information consumption**

The best personal productivity coach is yourself. [[Mindful Productivity]] is deeply personal.
