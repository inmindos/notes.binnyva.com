Working smarter is increasing insights.

Increasing insights can be done thru social and informal learning - connect our individual work with our teams, communities and networks. Find other perspectives, more ideas. Discuss with people who disagree with our conclusions.

Use the [[Seek-Sense-Share Framework]] to do this.
