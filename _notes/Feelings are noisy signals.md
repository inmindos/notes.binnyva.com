Feelings are noisy signals about met & unmet needs. 

Because our needs are unclear and [[Negative behaviours are to avoid a negative feeling|we have negative emotions, it can lead to negative behaviour]]

(In [[Control Theory]], "noisy" means "imperfect", not "loud"). There is a [[Feedback Loops in Noisy Environments|recommended approach to plan in such systems]]
