1. Decide what you want to learn
1. Research on the topic using multiple sources.
1. Collate all the interesting and useful information into one location
1. Condense this information into a blog post/article(optional: publish it in a [[learning in public]] system - there might be errors in this)
1. Create a plan to use this knowledge in a project
1. Do a retrospective after using the knowledge and seeing results - What worked, what didn't work, what can be improved.
1. Add these points to your article
1. Use the knowledge in another project(ideally, in a different contexts) and do the last 3 steps. You might have to do it 3-4 times before you have a decent understanding of it.

This is a modified version of the [[Organizational Knowledge Management]] process. This process is more geared for [[Personal Knowledge Management]] and skill building.
