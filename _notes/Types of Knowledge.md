There are three types of knowledge in [[Organizational Knowledge Management]]...

- **Explicit knowledge**: documented knowledge - processes, FAQs, research, etc. Eg. [[Documentation Framework]] will be for this.
- **Tacit knowledge**: practical know-how that comes thru experience. Difficult to articulate and pass on.
- **Implicit knowledge**: Intuitive knowledge that comes thru mastery or years of experience.
