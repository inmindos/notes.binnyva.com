Know the list of areas that you will generally be biased in(eg. I have a tendency to have a positive bias) - so that you can be more mindful in those areas - or even figure out ways to limit your choices in those areas.

This can also be used for things that you are easily tempted by(eg. not having cigarettes in your house if you are trying to quit smoking). Useful for [[Willpower Rules]].

The term comes from Ulyseses asking is men to tie his hands when going towards the Sirens in Homer's Odessy book.
