Value can be extrinsic(money) or intrinsic(love of your family, interest in a hobby). But in a market economy only extrinsic values are given any weight. This leads to commodification of intrinsic values.

Eg. You love to play the guitar, you enjoy playing it. But all your friends push you to try to make money from it - try to get you play at gigs, etc.
