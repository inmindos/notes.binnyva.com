Eudaimonia is not an emotion, it is more a constant state of being.

Root word is in greek - Eu(Well) and Daimon(Spirit)

Many greek philosophers claimed that Eudaimonia constitutes the goal of humanity.

## Different Definitions

- Stoics claimed that eudaimonia meant living in accordance with nature - rationally understanding our place in nature and living accordingly. See also, Tranquility
- Epicureans defined eudaimonia in terms of pleasure - a calm absence of pain and the absence of mental concerns.
- Cyrenaics claimed that physical hedonistic pleasure is the ultimate goal. Not Eudaimonia.

Empesised by Plato and Aristotle

Arete - Virtue or Excellence. Being your highest self. 

## [Nichomachean Ethics Lecture 2: Eudaimonia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKpvMijDAkY)

You do things for a purpose. There is a hierarchy of purpose. The ultimate purpose would be Eudaimonia

- All things seek an end
- Ends are organized hierarchically
- Final end is Eudaimonia
	- Happiness
	- Self Realization or Fulfillment

## [Stoicism | What are Apatheia, Ataraxia & Eudaimonia?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shi5hMb3IBU)

Eudaimonia is living in accordance to nature. It has 2 components...

### Apatheia
Freedom of passions. Not Apathy. Closer to Equinimity.

Stoicism had 4 passions...
- Lupe : Sadness. Eg. You lost your job - and your thought about this and judging it as bad causes distress or Lupe.
- Phobos: Fear. Of Getting something that you don't want or losing something that you want. Fear leads to avoidance.
- Epithumia: Lust or craving. 
- Hedone: Delight. 

Engaging with these passions are not in accordance to nature. 

### Ataraxia

Tranquility or Equanimity. Freedom from worry and distress.
In stoics, this is not a goal - but a bye product of living in accordance with nature. Epicureans have it as an end goal.
You can transform bad passions into good passions. That will create Ataraxia. 

### Eudaimonia

Morally virtuous engagement with society and life in general in a way that benefits all.

Fulfillment would be the closest English word of Eudaimonia
