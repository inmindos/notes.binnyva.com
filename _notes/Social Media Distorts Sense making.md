We are programmed to observe the world and generalize our experiences into mental modals that can be used to understand and predict the world.

Social Media can distort this by showing very rare events fairly often - tricking us into thinking that's it happens more frequently. News media also can have this effect. This is the [[Availability Heuristic]].

Also, it tends to show us things that [[Motivated Reasoning|we already resonate]] with to increase engagement - this prevents us from seeing other side of the argument. This leads to extreme perspectives and polarization.
