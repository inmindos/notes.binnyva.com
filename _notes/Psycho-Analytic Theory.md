This is the theory that was developed by Sigmund Freud to explain human behavior. According to this theory, the conflict between the unconscious to do pleasurable things and the conscious to do the 'good' things creates all behavior. Most of this branch is no longer supported by modern psychology. 

Acc. to it, everyone has 3 parts...

- Id: The hidden/unconscious. Pleasure seeking and instinctive.
- Ego: Mostly conscious; mediate between Id and Super-ego.
- Super-Ego: The ideal self.

### Defense Mechanism

Ego's way of reducing anxiety by unconsciously distorting reality(similar to [[Memory Filters]])...

- Repression: Repressing thoughts, memories or feelings that create anxiety
- Regression: Going into a more child like mental state
- Reaction Formation: Changing unacceptable impulses into their opposite
- Projection: Projecting your own unacceptable impulses or feelings on to others
- Rationalization: Create more acceptable explanations to explain away the more real but unacceptable unconscious reasons for your action
- Displacement: Moving the unpleasant emotion to another victim
- Denial: Refuse to believe/accept unpleasant reality
