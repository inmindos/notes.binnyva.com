When people **give** gifts, they want...

- Surprise (the wow factor)
- Desirability (the clout factor)
- Materiality (the price tag)
- Social responsibility (that is, looking virtuous)

When people **get** Gift, they want:

- Usefulness (can I do something with it?)
- Versatility (can I do a variety of things with it?)
- Quality (is it well made/going to last?)
- Stuff they've asked for (did I actually say I want this?)
