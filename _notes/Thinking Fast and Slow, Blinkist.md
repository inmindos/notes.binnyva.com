Summary of the [[Thinking Fast and Slow]] book. Does not cover the things mentioned in the other note.

## Heuristics

Mental shortcuts to immediately make conclusions.

### Availability Heuristic

You overestimate the probability of something that you hear more often/remember easily. Eg. We think accidents kill more people than strokes.

### Substitution Heuristic

We substitute the actual question with an easier to answer question. Eg. "Will this man be a good secretary" becomes "Does this man fit my mental idea of a good secretary?"

## Memory Failures

- Duration Neglect: We remember specific memory from an event rather than the total duration.
- Peak End Rule: We overemphasize what happens at the end of the event rather that the entire event.

## Focus Difference in System 1 and System 2

When we encounter an easy problem we are relaxed/not focused. In this mode, the system 1 thinking is strengthened and system 2 weakened. When we are in this state, we will be more creative and intuitive. But we are more likely to make mistakes.

When we are focused on something, system 2 is more powerful. We'll be less creative - but we will be more analytical - and we will double check our judgments.

An easy way to switch between systems is to make the absorption of information more different(eg. listening to something on 2x / using difficult to read fonts.)

## Loss Aversion Drives action

We act more from fearing lose rather than trying to gain.
