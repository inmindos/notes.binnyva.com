Virtues in [[Stoicism]]...

- **Wisdom**: Knowing what is within our control and what is outside([[Locus of Control]]). Things are good, bad or indifferent. Keep things outside our control(like money, opinion of others, etc) in the indifferent category. If we have good money or good opinion in others eyes - that is good - but if not, it should not fundamentally affect our lives
- **Temperance**: Moderation - self discipline, self control. Balance short term pleasure with what is good for us in the long run.
- **Courage**: Act in the "right way" even when you feel fear, anxiety.
- **Justice**: Our duty to society. Be useful to others.
