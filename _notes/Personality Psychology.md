	- Their process is to ask how you would ideally like to be
	- And how you are currently
	- The close these two responses are, the better off state you are in
- Evolutionary Psychology
- [[Behavioral Psychology]]
	- Personality comes from the interactions with the environment
- Social Cognitive Theory
	- Behavior is explained as guided by expectation about the world and other people. Thinking and feeling is given the most importance.

### Philosophy of Personality

The scales that should be kept in mind when thinking about personality...

- **Free will vs Determinism**: How much of the behavior was chosen vs unconscious/environmental.
- **Nature vs Nurture**
- **Uniqueness vs Universality**: Gordon Allport, Maslow(of [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]), [[Environment for Self-Growth|Carl Rogers]] focus on the uniqueness of individuals. Behaviorists and Cognitive theorists, however, emphasize the universal principles.
- **Active vs Reactive**: Do individuals act on initiative or outside stimuli. Or are they passively shaped by their environment.
- **Optimistic vs Pessimistic**
