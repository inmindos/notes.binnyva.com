When learning a skill people go thru 5 cognitive progression stages. They learn to think differently in each stage...

## 1. Novice

They don't have a working mental model of the problem.

- Do things by following a process/rote
- Ask nonsense questions
- Cannot tell what's relevant and what's not.
- Its possible that they don't know that they are a novice(they might be confident due to [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]])

They can be helped by giving them concept maps - a visual model of the problem. Showing all components and the relationship between them.

To teach novices, you have to be a guide - tell them step by step.

## 2. Advanced Beginner


## 3. Competent

To teach people who are competent, you need to be  a mentor. Give them tasks and let them figure it out.


## 4. Proficient


## 5. Expert

- See solutions very quickly 
- They can switch between different points of views/approaches
- Much better at debugging(can explain the cause from the final effect)
- They have difficulty explaining their thinking - because it has become intuition to them.
