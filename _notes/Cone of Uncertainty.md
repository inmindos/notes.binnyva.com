This is a concept in planning that says that estimates are more vague at the start of the project. As time progress, the estimates gets better because there are lesser things you are uncertain about.

Items in a [[Scrum]] backlog should be sorted according to this cone. The items at the top of the board should be at the tail end of the cone(better estimates, least vague).
