Epistemology means the theory of knowledge or study of knowledge. Main questions in Epistemology are...

- What is the nature of knowledge?
- What are the obstacles to the attainment of knowledge?
- What can be known?
- How does knowledge differ from belief?

### How is knowledge obtained?

Empirisism: Knowledge can be obtained with our senses. But it can't be trusted always(eg. Optical Illusions). 

Rationalism: Knowledge can be obtained through reasoning.

### Types of Knowledge

Propositional Knowledge: Knowledge of facts(Eg. 3-1=2, A dog has 4 legs)
Practical Knowledge: Skill/Know-how(Eg. driving).

Epistemology has traditionally focused on propositional knowledge.

### What is Knowledge?

Knowledge is "Justified True Belief"

Someone know a Proposition only if...
- Proposition is true
- Subject believes(not just a hunch) the Proposition
- Subject is justified in the belief

### Why do we need Epistemology?

Pre-Socratic philosophers were "dogmatic" they believed that we could know reality in an objective way. But this later changed.

One of the main driving force of Epistemology has been fear...

> All epistemology begins in fear...fear that the senses are too feeble and the intellect too frail; fear that memory fades...fear that authority and conventions blinds; fear that God may keep secrets or demons deceive.
> Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison
