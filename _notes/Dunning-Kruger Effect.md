Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low competence in a field overestimate their competence. 

You need a certain amount of knowledge about a field to understand your own competence in it - if you have less that that, you tend to overestimate your competence.

People who don't know much think of themselves as experts. This is the opposite of [[Imposter Syndrome]]
