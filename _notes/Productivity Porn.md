Productivity Porn has the following signs...

- Unrealistic Demands
- Unrealistic Results(eg. 4 hour workweek)
- Guru-like persona

They give us the illusion of productivity. Procrastination can also be the manifestation of stress, anxiety, or impostor syndrome. Productivity porn acts as an escape from these.

The antidote to this is [[Mindful Productivity]]. Productivity is generally not a one-size-fit-all system - you'll need a [[Custom Productivity System]].
