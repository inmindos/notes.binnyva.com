Less, but better.

Intentionally select lesser things to focus on. When you have to decide if you want to pick up something, if its not a "Hell, yeah!", it should be a no. Do NOT select the 'maybe's.

To do this, you need to learn how to say No. This might make you a bit unpopular - so build the skill to say no firmly, resolutely and gracefully. 

Ask yourself: What's Important Now?
