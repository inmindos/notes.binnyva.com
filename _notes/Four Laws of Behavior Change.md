### 1. Cue: [[Behaviour Change - Make Cues Obvious|Make it Obvious]]

- Make the cue obvious. Change your environment to do this.
- Have a implementation intention: "I will BEHAVIOUR at TIME in LOCATION".
- Habit stacking. "After CURRENT HABIT, I will NEW HABIT"

### 2. Craving: [[Behaviour Change - Make the craving attractive|Make it Attractive]]

- **Temptation Bundling**: Pair an action that you want to do with the new habit you are trying to build.
- Join spaces where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.
- **Motivation Ritual**: Do something you enjoy before starting the difficult habit.

### 3. Response: [[Behaviour Change - Make the Action Easy|Make it Easy]]

- Reduce friction. Reduce the number of steps needed to take before the desired behavior.
- Prime the environment to make future actions easier.
 

### 4. Reward: [[Behaviour Change - Make the Reward Satisfying|Make it Satisfying]]

-  What is immediately rewarded is repeated. 
-  What is immediately punished is avoided

You can invert these laws to break bad habits.
