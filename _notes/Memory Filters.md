Before we store an event in our memory, it goes thru many filters. So the final memory is very different from the actual event. The filters are...

- Delete
- Distort
- Generalize 
- Personalizations

Before it reaches our memory storage.

This is especially true if the event had ideas that we didn't agree with - [[Motivated Reasoning]]/[[Confirmation Bias]]

This is a [[Neuro Linguistic Programming]] Communications Model.
