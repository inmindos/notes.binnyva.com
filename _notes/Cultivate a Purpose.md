Finding a purpose might be a wrong path to take to get a purpose. A better one would be to cultivate it.

People find purpose in one of the following ways...

1. Have a field/hobby that you explore for a long time
2. A sudden life event that changes your perspective/focus
3. Have a role model who have a very strong purpose
