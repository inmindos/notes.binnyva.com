When we encounter an easy problem we are relaxed/not focused. In this mode, the [[Thinking Fast and Slow|System 1]] thinking is strengthened and system 2 weakened. When we are in this state, we will be more creative and intuitive. But we are more likely to make mistakes.

When we are focused on something, system 2 is more powerful. We'll be less creative - but we will be more analytical - and we will double check our judgments.

An easy way to switch between systems is to make the absorption of information more different(eg. listening to something on 2x / using difficult to read fonts.)
