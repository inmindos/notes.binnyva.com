[[Deliberate practice]] is a method of learning by doing.

### Define success and Drill

- Define all aspects needed for success
- Drill each aspect

### Plan, Reflect and take notes

- Plan the practice
- After each session, reflect on what worked and what didn't
- Take notes on it

### Go slow

- Be slow - but correct. If you go fast, you might make mistakes that might become muscle memory.
- Start slow - and gradually increase the speed.

### Limit sessions to how much you can focus

- Training for a long time is useless if you can't focus on your training. Training session length should be as much as your attention span.

### Maximize Practice Time

### Have small scales - so that improvements are more visible

- If you are trying measure how fast you are running, measure in milliseconds rather than in seconds.

### Emulate practice of idols - not their performance

### Repetition Makes Perfect

### Get a coach
