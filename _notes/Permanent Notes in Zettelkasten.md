Some rules for permanent notes...
- Write one idea per note.
- Write as if you are writing for someone else - use full sentences, show sources.
- Be precise, clear and brief
- Should be understood even if you don't know the context it was taken from.

Format/Content of the note should be just these...
- Title
- The Idea
- Tags
- Source
- Links to other notes

Keep this in mind when creating a new permanent/concept note in [[Zettelkasten]]...
- Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to your existing content? 
- Can you combine it with existing content to create something new? 
- What questions are triggered?


Many people in the PKM space calls this a '*Zettel*'(note).
