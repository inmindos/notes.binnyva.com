In corporations, there three ways to influence behaviour...

- Incentives: Positive/Negative
- Process
- Culture

Eg. Getting people to show up to meetings on time...

- Incentive: dock pay for people who are late
- Process: don't allow anyone who's late into the meeting
- Culture: people feel strongly about showing up on time
