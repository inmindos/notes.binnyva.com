## Core Communication Skills

- Immediacy: You have no agenda - you are truly present to help the other
- Attending
- Authentic/Active Listening: Listen to understand - not listening to reply
- Positive outcome focused: Bring it to what people want rather than what they don't want.
- Reflecting back: Rephrase what they said
- Non-directed questions: Ask opened ended questions
- Appropriate silence: Wait a bit before responding. Be ok with a bit of silence.


## Personal Changes Changes so far
- Advising is seen as a negative trait
- Silence is appreciated more
- More confidence when searching 
- Trying to get empathy into the process
- Starter question - do you want to vent or do you want me to help.
- Listening without intent to reply.
