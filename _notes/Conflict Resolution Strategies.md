People have a preferred conflict resolution strategy. This is explored in the Thomas-Kilmann Model

- **Avoiding**: Ignore/ sidestep the issue hoping it will go away(flight)
- **Accommodating**: Tries to satisfy the other party at their own expense(fawn)
- **Compromising**: Tries to find acceptable solution that partly satisfies all parties.
- **Competing**: Prioritize own needs(fight)
- **Collaborating**: Finds a solution that satisfies all parties.
