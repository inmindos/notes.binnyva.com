**Parachute in, don't preamble**: Cold start - start with the action. Don't go with weak openers like "I'm here to tell you a story about when I learned..."

**Practice the start and the end**: You can go a bit off script in the middle - but the beginning and the end has to be powerful - and well practiced to be delivered well.

**Goldilocks theory of details**: Too much details and the audience is bored. Too few and they are not invested/ don't have enough context. Test your story with friends to get the detail level correct.

**Focus your deliver on specific persons**: Don't let your eyes just wash over the audience. Lock eyes and concentrate on specific people for 3-4 seconds and then move to the next person. This will let you actually connect with the audience better. 

**Use poetry**: Use fewer, but better words to carry more meaning. It will have more impact. 

**Use silence for impact and emphasis**: Don't be afraid of silence.

**Use the AIM framework**: Who is your Audience, what is your Intent and what is the Message.
