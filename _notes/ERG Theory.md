**Alderfer'sÂ ERG theory** is a different representation of the idea shown in [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]]. It shows human needs in three buckets...

- Existence: Physiological needs - food, water, safety, etc.
- Relatedness: Neeed to belong - friendships, relationships, sex, etc.
- Growth: Need for personal development, mastery. Esteem and Self actualization needs
