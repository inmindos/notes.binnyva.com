This is how you should split up your net income(in hand salary)...

- 50% of your income should pay your needs(Things you can't live without)
	- Rent
	- Groceries
	- etc.
- 30% for your wants(good to haves)
	- Travel
	- Eating out
	- Hobbies
- 20% Savings / Investments / Debt payments
	- Emergency Fund - 6-12 months of living expense.
	- Retirement Planning

PS: I've seen other sources where 30 and 20 are interchanged.
