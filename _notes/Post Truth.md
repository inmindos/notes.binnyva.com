Objective facts are given less importance in favor of arguments that appeal to emotion and personal beliefs.

Caused by the decline of authority of institutions - like church, govt, political parties etc. Earlier these were held up to provide us with answers - but now we don't truth them as much. 

It has come to the current level of prominence because of post modernism and internet.

- "Alternative facts" replace actual facts
- Feelings are more important than evidence.
