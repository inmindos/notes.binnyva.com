1. Voluntary risk is way more acceptable than involuntary risk. People are up to a 1000 times more accepting of voluntary risk when compared to involuntary risk.
2. Acceptance of risk is inversely proportional to prevalence of the activity.
3. Disease is a yardstick. We don't do things that are riskier than getting sick.
4. Novelty increases perceived risk(less you know about something, the more riskier you think it is).
5. Numbers are numbing(mass casualty events are acceptable)
