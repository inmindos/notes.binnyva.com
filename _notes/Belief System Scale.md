[[Belief Systems]] works at different scales... 

- One Person
- Small group where everyone knows each other(a friend circle)
- Community(a football fan club) 
- Large people groups(a race, religion, country)

Belief Systems in  larger groups are more dynamic - the beliefs will mutate and evolve when more people accept it and talk about it. It also creates a feedback loop - the community will strengthen the belief of its members. This happens because an individual member will see that others in the community has the same belief. This is why we get people who have strong beliefs in something most people believe is false - something like the flat earth theory. This can only happen if that person is in a community that believes it.
