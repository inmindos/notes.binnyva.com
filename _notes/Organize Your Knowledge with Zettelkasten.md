1. When you come across an idea, white it down. This is your inbox. Write it in your own words rather than copy/paste. Site your source in these notes. In my case, its in a text file. 
2. At the end of the day, import than into your Knowledge Tool(Eg. Foam, Roam Research, Notion, etc.)
   1.  When doing this, link to other existing notes.
   2.  Keep it as small as possible.
   3.  You can give the note an id like the date/time it was created(This will let you change file name without losing the links.)
   4.  Add tags to the note
