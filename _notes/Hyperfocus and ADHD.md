Hyperfocus: intense fixation on an activity for an long time. Hyperfocus can be a symptom of [[ADHD]].  A better way to look at it is that people with ADHD have a deregulated attention system. 

It might be caused by low amount of [[Dopamine]] - this deficiency makes it harder to take up boring-but-important tasks.
