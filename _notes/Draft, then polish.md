One method of writing is to NOT edit anything till you complete the entire piece. Then go back and polish. Rewriting might become an excuse to not continue.

When doing this, make sure you get the key details right. This can be achieved by having specific words at key parts of the text.

> Take special care with the last sentence of each paragraph—it’s the crucial springboard to the next paragraph.
> Omit needless words
> A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions: What am I trying to say? Which words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?
