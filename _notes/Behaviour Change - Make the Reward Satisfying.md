Law 4 of Behavior Change in [[Atomic Habits]].

The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. Timing is important - we prioritize immediate over delayed.

The other 3 laws([[Behaviour Change - Make Cues Obvious|make it obvious]], [[Behaviour Change - Make the craving attractive|make it attractive]], and [[Behaviour Change - Make the Action Easy|make it easy]]) makes it more likely that we do the habit this time. The 4th law makes it more likely that we repeat the habit next time.
