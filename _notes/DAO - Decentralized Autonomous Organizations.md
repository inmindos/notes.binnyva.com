Its a system that lets a group of people to code their process for decision making into a blockchain(eg. Smart Contracts in Ethereum). This software will become the tool that tallies votes and execute actions based on the encoded process.

This system will 'eleminate the middle man' - the centralized decision systems, organizational systems etc. will no longer be needed.

Decision-making can become more frictionless not only within collectives but also between collectives
