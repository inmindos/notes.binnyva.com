Centered around the question what does life mean?

Themes...

- Alienation: from the world - you are alone in the world, the world is foreign to you.
- Absurdity: You notice a lack of meaning

[[Albert Camus]]: Central philosophical problem is that of suicide. Does life have a meaning?

### [[Aristotle]]

- Human being strive for happiness
- Our excellence consists in fulfilling our function well
- What is our function? What are we for?

His answer is Rational Activity. Humans can act rationally - which animals can't.

### [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] 

Jean-Paul Sartre says "Existence precedes essence". By that he means there is no intrinsic meaning to life. But we are free to define ourself as we choose.

Facticity: There are things that are fixed - they can't be changed. But we are not - we have the power to chose and change as we wish.

We are "Self interpreting animals"(Charles Taylor). Our essence is to chose our own essence.

### [[Heidegger]] 

I give my life meaning thru projects I choose. This is freedom - but a limited freedom. My range of choice is not decided by me. 

"I'm thrown into the world". And because of that, I will feel alienated from the world.


### The Absurd

We confront the absurd when we seek meaning and can't find it. "We are not what we are - we are what we are not."


### [[Albert Camus]]

According to Camus, we confront the absurd in various experiences

- weariness with the routine
- seeing something out of context
- recognizing our own inability to act or understand.

His goal was "to live without appeal". Ie. live on my own terms. I don't appeal to anything external.

We create our own meaning - there is no external authority or meaning.

Camus draw from the absurd three consequence...

- my revolt (I revolt at the idea that life has no meaning - I will make one)
- my freedom 
- my passion (I live meaning to my life - and that makes it my meaning. I'll be passionate about it)

### Saul Bellow

"Seize the day, trusting as little as possible of the future" 

This is in opposition to what Aristotle says - act rationally, make plans, act long term. This tells us to be in the movement.

This is an Epicurean view...

- Materialism: World is only material things - I am my body.
- Determinism: We have no freedom - everything is determined by physical laws and what has gone before.
- Hedonism: Seek pleasure, seek freedom from fear, seek tranquility
- Self Control: To attain pleasure and tranquility you must know the world and limit your desire.
- Anonymity: "Live Unknown". Don't seek fame, glory or honor. Don't define success in a way that depends on other people - especially strangers.

The Burden of existence - comes from the story by Saul Bellow called 'Carpe Diem'

- Wilhelm confronts the absurd
- He feels throws into the world and feels a sense of alienation
- He mistakenly thinks of his life as a given, as a burden, as being in itself.
- "He was a little tired. The spirit, the peculiar burden of his existence lay upon him like an accretion, a load, a hump."
