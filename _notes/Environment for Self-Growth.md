According to Carl Rogers, the growth of your self depends on what your environment gives you. For a healthy self, you would want these thingsâ€¦

- Genuineness: You should be able to express yourself freely
- Positive Regards: You are accepted unconditionally by the people around you
- Empathy

If you have this, you will hold congruent views about yourself(how you see yourself matches how others see you).
