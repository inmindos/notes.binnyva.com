Warren Buffett's method of prioritization.

- Make a list of 25 things you want to do in life(or by end of year/end of month)
- Find the top 5
- Now you have 2 list - 5 top priority and 20 secondary. 
- Make sure you are NOT doing the bottom 20 - it will distract you from your primary [[SMART Goals|Goals]].
	- OR do the 20 only after the 5 are completed.
