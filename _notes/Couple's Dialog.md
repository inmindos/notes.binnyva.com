Use this format to frame your [[Overcoming Conflict Avoidance|conficts]]...

"I feel __________ when you ___________ \[Because ____________\] . I'd appreciate it if you did ____________ instead."

Eg. "I felt *angry* when you *watched Game of Thrones without me* because *you promised that we'll watch it together*. I'd appreciate it if you *wait for me to watch it with you* instead."

The 'When you ______' part should be something concrete. A good way of picking what to say is if a camera can see it. Eg. Say, "I felt afraid when you shouted at me." - rather than "I felt afraid when you got angry at me."
