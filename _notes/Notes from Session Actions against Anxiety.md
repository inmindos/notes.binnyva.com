### Parasitic Processing by John Vervaeke

Stimulus -> Response

In the case of parasitic processing, the response will look for more Stimulus - creating a loop.

You can put a pause between the Stimulus and the response.

Response is generally...
- Meaning Making
- Future Planning
- Ego response(self concern)

Pausing Mechanism

- Stoicism
- Practice : You have to do the pause method as a matter of practice. You will only do the method when you are anxious if you do it regularly.
- Boundaries : You have to find the right distance from the cause - being too close will make you dysfunctional.
- Faith
- Self Love
