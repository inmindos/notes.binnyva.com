We tend to believe that large events have large causes. This might be true in many instances, but not always.

Example: in one study, participants who were told that a plane had crashed and everyone died were more likely to believe it was a terrorist incident than one in which they were told a plane had crashed but people survived.

This is a major driver for conspiracy theories.
