Mental Model is a simplified mental representation of a complex real world system.

Mental Model is how we understand the world. When we try to make sense of something, we simplify parts of it, prioritize some parts - so as to reduce its complexity. This simplified version that we use to understand/reason with is the Mental model.

You can use this to...
- Understand systems
- Make Decisions

These are the elements of the Map part of [[Map vs Territory]]

The phrase Mental model is generally used to lump 3 types of ideas...

- Frameworks
- Thinking Tools: eg. Cognitive Bias Avoidance, Reasoning from [[First Principles]]
- Mental representations: Internal representations of knowledge about a problem domain

## Problems with mental model

Mental Models are the communicatable/codifiable parts of internal tacit knowledge. Just learning it might not be enough. You might need to building it from experience. [Source](https://commoncog.com/blog/the-mental-model-fallacy/)
