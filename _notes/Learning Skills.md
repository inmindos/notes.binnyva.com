There are two types of learning for skills..

- **Guided**: Reading a tutorial, watching a YouTube video, etc. Anything where you're following a guide.
- **Unguided**: Creating your own projects, adding new features, looking things up in the docs. Anything where you aren't following a guide.

We have to find a balance - more guided at the start, and move towards unguided when you get comfortable.

The tutorial fade Technique: Build once with the tutorial, then try to build it again without the tutorial.

Have a [[Growth Mindset]] when learning - there will be [[Discomfort Drives Growth|discomfort]] - but that struggle will teach you. Think of it as a workout.

Have a goal in mind - a project to build. Rather than just learning for the sake of learning.

Create a daily habit - keep a small time every day to practice.
