Your self-concept is the collection of beliefs you hold about yourself. These smaller, specific beliefs are called the Self-schema. They are old sets of memories that would have generalized into beliefs about yourself. For eg, the [[Self-Schema]]/belief that 'I am introverted'.

A major feature of this self-schema is that it acts like a self fulfilling prophecy. Your self-schema tells you how to act, and highlights your memories when you acted that way. If you have a self-schema that says 'I am introverted', that will drive your actions at a party(stand by yourself in one of the corners of the room). And when you try to remember the last party you went to, you will tend to remember it in a way that supports your existing belief that you are an introvert: "I hated going to the party because I didn't want to interact with people".

These self-schemas are generally given to us in our childhood by our caregivers when they tell us how to behave. For eg. "Good girls don't make noise." Lot of our current behaviors come from these "Good child/bad child" schemas. [[Transactional Analysis]](a system of therapy) says that these childhood schemas can lead to lifelong standards you hold yourself to - called [[TA - Drivers|Drivers]].

According to Carl Rogers, Self concept has 3 parts...

- [[Self-Image]](How I see myself)
- [[Self-Esteem]](How valuable I think I am)
- [[Ideal Self]](How I want to be)

People can have a [[Social identity theory|social identity]] as well.

### Existential

- We see ourselves as separate from the world
- Distinct from others
- Constant(as opposed to temporarily tired(which is a state))
