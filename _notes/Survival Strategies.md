Evolutionary Ecology has 2 Survival strategies:

- r-selection
- k-selection

Differences...

r-selection: many offspring, low investment
K-selection: few offspring, high investment

r-selection: expand into open niches
K-selection: compete for crowded niches

r-selection: unlimited inputs (e.g. rabbits rarely run out of grass)
K-selection: scarce inputs (e.g. predators frequently face starvation)

r-selection: unstable habitats
K-selection: stable habitats
