The tech industry has had a new center roughly every fifteen years. A model of computing sets the agenda, and the company or companies that win that model dominate the industry, and everyone is scared of them, and then a new model comes along, forms a new center, and the old model stops mattering.  Mainframes were followed by PCs, and then the web, and then smartphones. 

Something similar to the paradigm shift that happens in science.
