Disciplined questioning that enables critical thinking...

1. **Clarification** – "What do you mean by...?"
1. **Probing assumptions** – "What could we assume instead?"
1. **Probing reasons/evidence** – "Why do you think this is true?"
1. **Implications and consequences** – "What effect would that have?"
1. **Different viewpoints** – "What would be an alternative?"
1. **Questioning the original question** – "What was the point of this question?"
