A person can make themselves happy or miserable regardless of what is actually happening outside - just by changing the contents of consciousness.

State of optimal experience : flow
- Nothing Else matters
- Intense Concentration, no attention for problems or anything else
- Lose yourself
- Time get distorted

You should do things that are the right amount of challenge. If too challenging, it will lead to anxiety - it too little, you'll be bored.

Goal of life is to be in this state as much as possible.
