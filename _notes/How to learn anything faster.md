1. **Sharpen the Ax**: Do some study on what is the best way to learn that specific skill - rather than just starting to learn it.
1. **Use hacks to optimize focus**: Things like Pomodoro or 2 Minute rule.
1. **Find opportunities for immersion**: Work in contexts that requires you to use the skill.
1. **Find the weak links**: Understand the specific areas you are weak at - and find a way to drill them in.
1. **Test yourself/Active Recall**: We don't learn by putting knowledge into our mind - we learn when we try to take out knowledge from our mind.
1. **Get feedback**: But find what type of feedback you need at what point - positive feedback will be better in the beginning. But once you get decent, find tight feedback loops - get feedback often.
1. **Over-learning**: Learn it in more depth than necessary. Understand the why.
1. **Spaced Repetition**: Test yourself on the forgetting curve. 
1. **Teach what your trying to learn**: Document your process of learning and teach it to others. This will solidify your learning.
