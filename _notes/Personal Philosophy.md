Everyone has a personal philosophy. Try to make it an intentionally reasoned and chosen one - and not an amalgamation of all that has accumulated in your brain because of the environment that you were in.

You can do this by introspection and reflection. If you don't do it, you'll take your inner mental states for granted - acting as your emotions dictate. You'll be acting without know the context(reality), the cause(motivations) and the consequence(goals) of their actions.
