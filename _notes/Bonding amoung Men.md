Men bond with other men by a couple of methods...

- 'Banter': making fun, teasing etc. 
- Shared activities: Watching a game, playing games, etc. 

Women can share intimate information to bond - with women and other men. Men do not have this as a default method. If men have to do it there is some level of effort involved(eg. Therapy).
