PARA is a [[Personal Knowledge Management]] framework

- **Projects**: Series of tasks with a end goal and deadline. Eg. Launch MindOS publicly
- **Areas**: An ongoing system that needs to be maintained. Think workflows. Eg. PKM through [[Zettelkasten]]. This is long term and open ended.
- **Resources**: Topic of interest. Eg. PKM
- **Archives**: Inactive items for the other three categories. Projects that are completed, areas that have been abandoned, etc.

The idea is to have these 4 folders in your file manager/Google Drive/Todo App - and organize your life in these 4 folders. The data will flow thru these structures when you work on it.
