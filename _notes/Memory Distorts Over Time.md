Different ways a memory can change...

1. Transience: Memory decay - you remember lesser and lesser as more time passes.
2. Blocking: Interference of one memory that prevents access of another. Tip of tongue issue. Eg. you can't remember the name of your teacher when you meet her outside of the school.
3. Absent-mindedness: Can't remember because you didn't pay attention.
4. Miss-attribution: You miss-attribute the source of the memory.
5. Suggestibility: Memory change because you get new information or leading questions.
6. Bias: Memory changes to fit your existing beliefs, age, mood, etc. It can change memory at encoding stage or at retrieval.
7. Persistence: Intrusive and disturbing memories come into awareness often. Eg. PTSD.
