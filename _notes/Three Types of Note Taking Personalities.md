### Gardeners

The word [[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden|Digital Garden]] comes from this type.

- Less structured - open ended
- You look at your notes again and again
- Notes can grow over time
- Eg. Roam, Obsidian

### Architects

- You build your own organisation structure
- Customised system for you.
- Eg. Notion

### Librarians

- Every note has one specific place
- Highly organised
- You might not go back to these notes. Lots of new notes get saved - but not revisited
- Eg. Evernote, Onenote

### Students

- Have a short term goal in mind
- Surface level information is enough.
- Eg. Google Keep
