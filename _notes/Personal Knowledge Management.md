## Note Taking

At the core of all PKM are note taking systems...

### Capturing Information

- Note taking
- Bookmarking Pages
- Highlighting sections
- Etc.

### Managing Information

- Classification/Tagging of captured information
- Summarizing bigger chucks of information(even better, systems like [[progressive summarization]])
- Synthesizing

### Using Information

- Going thru the information later to remember
- Creating new content
- Sharing notes

## PKM Systems

1. Commonplace Books: Writing facts, ideas, quotes, etc in notebooks.
2. Index Card System: Every note in separate index card, organized thematically.
3. [[Zettelkasten]]: Separated notes, but link-able to each other. Organization happens organically thru clustering due to linking.
4. Note Taking Apps: Evernote, OneNote, Notion, etc.
5. Personal Wikis: Interlink-able notes. Eg. TidilyWiki.
6. Specialized Software: Specific software to support existing workflow like Zettelkasten. Eg. Roam Research, Obsidian.
