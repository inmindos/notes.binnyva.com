## Type of Jokes

### Misdirection

### Rule of three

Serious, Serious, Funny

> "Giving 110% takes hard work, dedication and a complete disregard for how math works."

Funny, Funnier, Funniest

### Literal

Using the exact meaning of the words.
Eg. Surely, you can't be serious? I am serious and don't call me Shirley.

### Puns

### Exaggerations

Eg. It was so cold that I saw polar bears wearing jackets.

### Simile

Comparing similarities between two different things.
Eg. Dissecting comedy is like dissecting a frog. You understand it better, but they both die in the end.

### Sarcasm

A sharp, bitter or cutting remark.
Eg. Money isn't everything in life, but it does keep you in touch with your children.

## Typical Joke Structure

- Premise: Broad 
- Setup: Specific
- Punch Line: Surprised
- Tag(Another Punch line): Another Surprise
- Act Out: Acting out the punch line
- Call Back: Referencing later in your act.

- Premise: Like most comedians, I grew up poor.
- Setup: We didn't know we were poor because our mom lied about it. I remember one Christmas she tried to tell my sisters she had given them - dolls.
- Punch Line: But they were really just empty bottles of Mrs. Buttersworth
- Tag: And she was like "No, no - that's kitchen barbie!"

Put the punch word at the end.

## Delivery

- Sell the punch line. You must be confident - and deliver it properly.
- Don't ask the audience questions. (?)
- Say most with less words. Brevity is the soul of wit.
- Hard consonants stick in ear better - 'pants' are funnier than 'jeans'.
- Go twice as slow as you think you are going.
- Don't step on your laughs.
- Movement on stage is good.
- Silence is ok.
- Keep your jokes in your pocket and let them come out organically.
