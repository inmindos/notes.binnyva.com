People can cultivate positive emotions by learning to change the stories they tell themselves about the events in their lives. This is what [[ABC of CBT]] does as well.

People can change a story by three lenses...
- reverse lens: "What would the other person in this conflict say and in what ways might that be true?"
- long lens: "How will I most likely view this situation in six months?"
- wide lens: "Regardless of the outcome of this issue, how can I grow and learn from it?"
