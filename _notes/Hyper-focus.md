[[Mind-Wandering]] is natural. But if you can notice it wondering and bring it back to your original single intention, you will lead a richer and more enjoyable life.

> "Directing your attention toward the most important object of your choosing - and then sustaining that attention - is the mont consequential decision you will make today"  

Mind tries to find other things to do when you are focused. The difficulty to keep your focus will depend on these...

- External Distractions: Your phone notifications, clutter on your table, etc.
- Internal Distractions: Internal thoughts, undone tasks that you keep thinking about, etc.
- Mental stimulation: If your current task is boring, mind tries to find more 'interesting' things to focus on.

One way to keep better focus is the 'pre-focus' exercise. Chose one point on the wall, or your body to focus on. Keep your focus on it for one minute. When your mind wanders, bring it back to the point. After a minute of doing it, you'll find it more easier to focus on your intention.

Don't try to keep your hyper-focus for more than 90 mins. Let it rest by going into scatter focus mode(also know as Mindful Mind-wandering).
