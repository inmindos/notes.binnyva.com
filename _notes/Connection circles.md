How to create connection circles...

1. Identify key elements of the system under study. It's a 'key' element if...
	- It changing will be important for the system
	- It can increase or decrease
	- Is a noun(eg. Bug tickets)
2. Write this around the circles - make sure its less than 10.
3. Find all cause and effect relations...
	- Elements that causes other elements to increase/decrease
	- Draw a arrow between the two
	- Mention increase/decrease using a +/- at the effect end.
4. Find relations that are a closed loop - these are feedback loops.
