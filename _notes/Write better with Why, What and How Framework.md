Use can use this in the [[Project Documentation]].

## Why

Explain the problem and context.

- Why is this document important
- Explain the problem
- Expected benefits of solving it.
- Why now

This section is the "hook". People who read the why should feel they need more details(rest of the document).

## What

Describe the solution. Expected outcomes and how to measure it.

- Success conditions/ Functional requirements
- Constrains/ Non-functional requirements
- Trade offs to be made

## How

- Methodology
- High level design 
- Tech decisions

You can add how you DON'T want to implement too(out of scope things).
