**Building A Second Brain** is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we've gained through our experience. 

## Remember

1. Curate the content you want to consume
2. Keep the notes on the content inside the Project folder (PARA System)
3. Keep only what "resonates" with you. This is generally what you care about, wonder about, or find inherently intriguing.

## Connect

Distilling your notes into actionable, bite-sized summaries. Think [[Zettelkasten]]

1. Write notes about the content in a way that the future you can understand(define terms, include sources)
2. Use [[Progressive Summarization]]
3. Organize your notes bit by bit over time.

## Create

1. Create using the notes
2. Make small, reusable units of work.
3. Share often, share online.
