State are the variables in a [[Complex Systems]] - you can study a system by looking at how the states changes. If states change relative to time, its a linear change(if not, non-linear). Complex systems are generally non-linear. 

- Stable System - stays the same with small state changes.
- Unstable System - system can be disrupted with small changes.
- Chaotic system - very sensitive to small changes, unpredictable.

There will be systems where a small change can be a tipping point to change the entire system behavior.
