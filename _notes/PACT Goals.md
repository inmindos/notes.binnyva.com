[[SMART Goals]] are good for small tasks. But for larger goals, they break down. PACT system is more useful for those. Eg. "Learn Coding"

- **Purposeful**: Your goal be connected to your long-term purpose in life
- **Actionable**: The outcome should be connected to actions you can take right now.
- **Continuous**. Actions you take should be simple and repeatable. Use Continuous improvement - start, then adapt as needed.
- **Trackable**: Stats don't apply to many types of goals. Try to find a binary approach - yes/no. Have you done the thing or not? Eg. Have you coded today?
