A goal is a recognizable, desired state in the future, that causes you to act differently in the present in order to realize it. It is...

- Recognizable - could be a concrete numerical target or just “I'll know it when I see it”. Without this, it's just a trajectory
- Desired state in the future. If it's not desired, then it's not your goal, it's something you think you *should* do.

Good goals are [[SMART Goals]].
