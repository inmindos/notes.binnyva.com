When there is a [[Willpower Challenge]] failure, you can give yourself a self compassion message.
- Mindfulness of your thoughts and feelings
- "Everyone is imperfect" - rather than "I am broken". Don't let this failure be explained by your identity.
- Encouragement over criticism. What you have told a close friend who would have had that failure.
