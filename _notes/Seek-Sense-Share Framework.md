Part of the [[Personal Knowledge Mastery]] school of thought.

- **Seeking** - learning and keeping updated. Know who in your network knows what.
- **Sensing** - personalize knowledge. Reflect on what you learn. Try using the knowledge in a practical manner. If done collectively, it will become [[Sense Making]].
- **Sharing** - Share ideas, resources with others. Welcome help requests from others - sharing at point of need is more effective.
