Pessimism when planning has a good effect on your plan to change.

1. What is your goal?
2. What would be the most positive outcome?
3. What action will I take to reach this goal?
4. What is the biggest obstacle?
5. When and where is this obstacle most likely to occur?
6. What can I do to prevent the obstacle?
7. What specific thing will I do to get back to my goal when this obstacle happens?

Keep track of your failures and your successes. Failures might be more important.
