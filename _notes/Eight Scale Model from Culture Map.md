- Consensual cultures make decisions collectively.
- In Top-down cultures, one person(usually the leader) makes the decision for everyone.

### Disagreement Scale: Confronting vs Avoiding

- Confronting cultures values a good debate and sees values for it in a team
- Avoiding cultures put people relationship at the forefront.

### Scheduling Scale: Linear vs Flexible
