List all your project stakeholders into 3 buckets...

- Doers: People who work on the project. Eg. Developers, PO
- Supporters: People who support indirectly. Eg. Account Manager
- Followers: People who are interested in the outcome of the project.

This can have person or group of people. It can have internal or external people as well.

Best time to do this would be the kickoff meeting for the project.
