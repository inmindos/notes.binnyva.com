Key Ideas...

- **Borrowed creativity** - what we create is remixing things we learn
- **Capture habit** - brain is for "having ideas" - not storing ideas.
- **Idea recycling** - 12 favourite problems(?)
- **Project over Categories** - Put ideas that you get into the 'Project' folder rather than the category the idea belongs to.
- **Slow Burn** more important than Heavy Lift - Work on multiple projects - all on slow burner. 
- **Start with Abundance** - Don't start with a blank page. When starting a project, search for related information within your system
- **Intermediate Packets** - Content blocks that you create for one article can be used in others.
- **You only know what you make** - you make notes - that's all you know from what you consumed
- **Make it easier for your future self** - notes should be self explanatory
- **Keep your ideas moving** - don't focus on the details of the note taking implementation - write notes, connect notes
