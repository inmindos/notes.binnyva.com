When doing a long term plan, define your fears as well as your dreams. 

Mitigate the fears. Its fear that stops us from trying things - we generally rather be unhappy than uncertain. You can mitigate it by using these questions when ever you stop yourself from doing something that scares you...

1. What are you not doing because of fear
2. What are you missing out by not doing it?
3. Why aren't you doing it?
4. What's the absolute worst case scenario?
5. If the worst happens how can you fix it?
6. What is the most likely outcome?
