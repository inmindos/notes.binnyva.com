- **Wishful thinking**: Prioritize information that puts yourself in a good light - and ignore the distressing aspects.
- **Conservatism**: Difficulty in changing strongly held beliefs in light of new data.
- **Conformism**: Interpreting our knowledge based on how our community thinks. 
- **Binary / Black and White**: Seeing things at either extremes. Good or bad, clever or dump. Similar to over-generalization.
- **Mind Reading**: People project their own thoughts, motivations, etc when trying to understand other's thinking.
- **Individual Centric thinking**: Attribute major events to the one visible leader. Eg. Hitler is responsible for WW2.
- **False Causation/Co-relation linking**: We are hard wired to make connections with small data sets. This is often wrong.
