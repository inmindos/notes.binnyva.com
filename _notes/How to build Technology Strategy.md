How the role of CIO(Chief Information Officer) evolved over the years...

- First Wave : Automation. Eg. Reduce human error.
- Second Wave : Process Optimization Eg. Six Sigma
- Third Wave : Strategic Role

## Mindset

Generally, IT Depts think they are building tools for another Dept - making the other dept the customer. 
- This puts the IT dept subservient to the customer dept.
- You don't think what the end user wants - you only look at what the customer dept wants.

## OGTM Model 

This is a model used to create organizational strategy

- Objectives: Company or Dept's long term objectives(3-5 years)
	- Define all Objectives
	- Prioritize 
- Goals: [[SMART Goals]]
- Tactics: What you are doing to make sure the goals are met.
- Measures: Metric to measure the success of your tactic(instead of the goal)

## Stakeholder Analysis

- List all stakeholders - at org level
- Prioritize stakeholders
	- According to Org objectives/goals
	- According to pre-existing support
- For top stakeholder, find...
	- What does the org want from the stakeholder
	- What the stakeholder wants from the org
	- What concerns are there
- Build out a User Persona

## [[SWOT Analysis]]

## Next Steps
- Figure out Common factors in Org and Dept goals.
- Find the cost of ownership(more than just the development cost)
- Identify the trends in technology.
- Have a organizational Tech Prioritization Meeting
