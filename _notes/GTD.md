GTD/Getting Things Done is a time management system that works on the principle of getting information from your mind to an outside system. It follows this workflow...

1. Capture: Write down every task that has your attention into a app/book.
2. Process: Decide the next action to take for this task to be done. If you can't do that, can it be trashed? Or put on hold?
3. Organize: Have a system to remind you of tasks in the correct context. Eg. all emailing tasks should show up when you open your email inbox.
4. Reflect: Review the system and repeat.
5. Do: Work on the important things that came out in step 2 - one at a time.
