Type of Economy depends on 

- **Ownership of Capital** - Govt vs Private
- **Central Coordination** - Deciding what to produce. Govt Coordination vs Private Sector.
- **Use of Markets** - How prices are decide, regulations, etc. Govt fixed vs Market forces.

No current economy is fully capitalistic - all factors completely in the private side. All economies are in a gradient scale of these three factors.
