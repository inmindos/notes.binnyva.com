## Features

* Huge web of knowledge
* Retrieve right memory when needed
* Find meaningful connections among topics
* Develop ideas and arguments
  
## Method

1. Take notes when reading/viewing/etc.
2. Take reference notes - when you got the info from
3. Make permanent notes - when going thru the reference notes, think how they link to your research, your interest, thinking etc.
   1. Goal is not to make a lot of notes
   2. But to add value to your existing, ideas arguments or discussions.
   3. Find connection between what you just learned - and what you already know.
      1. More info = more hooks to connect new information to
      2. More connected info = more cues we can use to trigger the right memory

### Finding Meaningful connections

Ask yourself...

1. How does this idea fit into what I already know
2. Can this be explained by something else
3. What does this idea mean for another idea I already have
4. Can I use this idea to explain another idea

### Add Keywords/tags to your notes

Think which circumstances do I want to stumble on this note?

### Fleeting notes

Write down ideas when you get them. Review them within a few days and convert them into permanent notes.

## Long Term

Review and repeat this for a while. After you have a web of knowledge, see what's missing, compare connections etc.
