[[LEAP Ethical Selling Framework]]

## Listen 

### 3 Core Principles for Listening

- Join the conversation going on in their mind
- Attunement - Be attuned to them
- Try to be a problem finder rather than a problem solver

### Be an Explorer

- Ask Questions
- Assign the correct meaning to the given answers
- Question the answers
- Beware of confirmation bias - you might be assigning meaning that you want to be true.

Be interested in the other person rather than trying to be interesting.

### Question to ask yourself

1. What are their fears and frustrations?
2. What are their wants and aspirations?
3. What problem are they trying to solve?
	- What is the problem behind that problem? 
		- What is behind that? [[5 Whys]]

See sales as an act of service.

## Explain

### Questions to ask yourself

1. What makes this buyer a 'no' for you?
2. What should make this offer a clear 'no' for them?
3. What can you say to make it very clear that they are in control and that you don't need their purchase?

## Ask

### How to handle a 'No'

Be Ok with it. Offer a no to them during the conversation.

- "In what way the offer don't meet your needs?"
- "What would have made it an yes?"
- "Can I follow up with you at a later time?"
- "Is there anything else that I can help you with?"
- "Would you want me to give you some resources that might help you with the problem(books, links, etc.)?"
- "Anyone comes to mind who might be interested in this?"

### Questions to ask yourself

1. What vision do they have - and where don't they overlap with your vision? 
	- Helps you understand the fears and objections.
2. What's the best way to make the ask based on their vision?
3. How can you make sure that no is a valid option for them?

What is a typical reaction when you hear a no? What would be a more helpful reaction?
