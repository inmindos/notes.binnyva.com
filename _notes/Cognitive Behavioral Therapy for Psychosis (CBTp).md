### Structure of [[CBT]] Session

- Agenda Setting - 2 Mins
- Homework Review - 5-10 Mins
- Clinician Item and Homework setting - 15 mins
- Client Item - 15 Mins
- Feedback - 2 Mins

Catch it, Check it, Change it

### Problem

- Trigger(Makes the problem more likely to happen - eg. having an argument with my partner) & Modifier(Makes the problem better or worse - eg. Sleep, mood)
- Precipiter(Something that happened - significant life event)
- Beliefs
	- Vulnerability Factors(Genetics, childhood trauma)
- Maintenance
	- Treatment Targets	

### Common Maintenance Processes

Things that keep a Psychosis going on

- Safety Behaviors and Avoidance - if something is frightening, we avoid it
- Reduction of Activity - stay in all day when depressed
- Catastrophic Misinterpretations - 
- Self fulfilling prophecies
- Performance Anxiety
- Fear of Fear
- Perfectionism
- Short-Term Rewards - substance use, self harm

Different mental health issues as viewed by CBT

- Psychosis: traditionally discussed as the difficulty in distinguishing what is real from what is not real.
- Delusion: fixed false beliefs held in the face of contrary evidence

- Depression -> distorted beliefs about self worth & Efficacy
- Anorexia -> fixed false belief about being overweight
- Panic Disorder -> Distorted belief about physical safety
- OCD -> Distorted beliefs - thought-action fusion

Psychosis is characterized by culturally unacceptable interpretation of experiences

- Stigmatizing and distressing => Maintains Psychosis

Implications:

- Normalizing may reduce stigma and distress
- CBT techniques might be successful in psychosis too.

Eg. 2 woman feel a lump in their breast, one gets test that says its benign - but still believe that its cancer. Other thinks that its a govt. installed thought monitoring device. Second woman is said to have psychosis.

### Self-Regulatory Executive Functioning Model

CBT Theory of Auditory Hallucinations(AHs)

AHs are mis-attributed internal events(Eg. verbal thoughts, inner speech)

Individuals with psychosis are...
- Less likely to recognize thoughts as their own
- Less likely to recognize own voice played back with minor distortions
- Tend to assuming that ambiguously sourced info was generated externally

Goal might not be to remove distorted belief entirely - reduction of conviction can be very helpful

### Types of Homework

- Information Collection 
	- Current Functioning
	- Current Symptoms, experiences, thoughts, affactive states, etc.
	- Track substance use and relationship to symptoms
- Experiments
	- Discover what happens when client thinks/behaves differently
	- Exploration of different outcomes from different actions
- Practice New Skills
	- Intense Repetition is necessary for behavior change

#### What to choose for homework: 3 R's

- Is it Relevant
	- To the model
	- To the case conceptualization
	- To the content of the session
	- To the clients goals
- Is it Realistic
	- Is it achievable
	- Is it challenging enough to feel significant but not so difficult that its impossible
- Is it the clients Responsibility
	- Is it within the client's control
	- Is it the clients responsibility to address

Homework should be chosen by both therapist and the client

- Ensure client understands the rational
- If client does not do the homework...
	- Do not shrug and move on - find out why
	- Be curious, not confrontational
	- Involve support network/family
