Time blocking is a time management method that divides a day into multiple time blocks. Each block is for a specific task, with the intention to stay focused on that task exclusively. To use this well, create your task list in advance - ideally at the start of the day.

## Types of Time Blocking

#### Task Batching

Group similar tasks so that it can be done together. Eg. all calls in the same batch. Think of this as contexts in [[GTD]].

#### Day Themes

Each day of the week has a different theme so that you can focus on different types of tasks every day. Eg. content writing on Monday, social media on Tuesday, etc.

#### Time Boxing

Create a time frame by which you'll complete a task. End the task at the end of the time frame even if its not fully done.  Pomodoro technique is an example of this with a predefined time frame.

## Process  

- List high priority tasks.
- Block time for...
	- Deep work(no distraction work)
	- Shallow work(Easy work - check emails, social media, etc)  
	- Breaks. Do not skip this.
- Block larger time frame that you think the task will require. You'll often overshoot the time block.
- Leave a couple of blocks free for unforeseen work or work that overshot their time.  
- Put up all the selected tasks with the time when you are doing it. A good option for this part is to use Google Calendar. You can put all these tasks in a separate calendar - and change the colour when its done.
