Dunbar, who created the [[Dunbar's Number]], says that language is a 'cheap' form of social grooming(akin to flea picking in apes). Its more efficient - you can talk to more than one person at a time - and you can do it when doing other things.

But its not freely salable.

Conversation can go up to 5 people - but rarely does it go beyond that. If there is more than 5 people, it generally splits into smaller groups.
