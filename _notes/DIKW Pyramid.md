DIKW Pyramid is a model that is useful in [[Personal Knowledge Management]]. 

Data > Information > Knowledge > Wisdom

- Data with context is information.
- Information with understanding is knowledge. 
- Using knowledge to make better decisions and outcomes leads to Wisdom.

An alternative view is...

Data > Information > X > Knowledge > Wisdom

In my opinion, the X(the missing part) is Reflection. The process of thinking about the Information and putting it into practical use.
