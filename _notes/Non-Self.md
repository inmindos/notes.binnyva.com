Buddhism has a different view of self when compared to the [[Self-Concept|west]].

Self has 5 parts..

- Form: Physical body and material phenomena
- Feeling: Pleasant and unpleasant emotions
- Cognition: Thoughts, Memories, future plans, ideas
- Mental Formations: volitional activities, dispositions, decision making
- Consciousness: Fact of awareness

These 5 parts are the components, and the when it comes together, it creates an effect of having a self. But its still not the self because..

- You can't control these completely
- Its not permanent

Self and attachment to self is the cause of suffering.
