The mind is not only connected to the body but that the body influences the mind (in a way that the two always have to be considered together).

> Cognitive science calls this entire philosophical world-view into serious question on empirical grounds... (the mind) arises from the nature of our brains, bodies, and bodily experiences. This is not just the innocuous and obvious claim that we need a body to reason; rather, it is the striking claim that the very structure of reason itself comes from the details of our embodiment... Thus, to understand reason we must understand the details of our visual system, our motor system, and the general mechanism of neural binding.
