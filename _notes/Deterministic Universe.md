Also called a clockwork universe. We will be in a deterministic universe if everything is predictable. If all actions are the direct result of earlier actions and laws governing interactions between system.

The physical universe on a macro scale is considered deterministic. We can calculate the location of a planet if we know its earlier position and the rules regarding its motion.

This is more complicated in case of more complex systems - like human actions. Things are not that predictable.
