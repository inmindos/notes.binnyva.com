[Useful, Not True](https://sive.rs/u) is a book by Derek Sivers

Reason why I read this book: I'm learning about [Belief Systems](https://mindos.in/posts/06-belief-systems/). Specifically how to change your belief to something more useful.

> **Beliefs have a purpose.** They help us adopt a perspective or identity. They help us take action, or cooperate with others.

Everyone has a set of comforting 'make belief' statements. For eg. "Everything happens for a reason" or "They will get what they deserve". 

Your [[Initial Impressions]] about something will control your mind. It takes a more effort to let go of the first thought. 

A good way to soften our beliefs is to have a belief that we don't know most things.

Belief can create emotions that might be helpful/harmful to your goal. Chose accordingly.

After you decide on a belief, you need to internalize it. Journaling is a good way to do that. You can use these prompts to help you...

- Here is how this belief will help me _____
- Here is how I'd explain it to a stranger in 30 seconds _________

Fill your mind with the new belief. Talk to others about your belief. People might tell you its wrong. That's ok. You don't need to defend it. Its just your belief. But these criticism will help you to find its failure points, and plan for it.

Its helpful to take the first steps quickly. The more you wait, the more your mind tires to give you reasons why not to do it
