Learning in psychology(esp. [[Behavioral Psychology]]) is through classical or operant conditioning. Its a change in behavior depending on the environment.

## Classical Conditioning

Pavlo's dog experiment was Classical conditioning. Conditional Stimulus(Bell) comes before the change in action.

## Operant Conditioning

Consequences lead to change in voluntary behavior

### Reinforcement

Eg. Giving a child candy for doing something good. Conditioning is after the action.

### Punishment

Eg. Beating a child for doing something wrong.
