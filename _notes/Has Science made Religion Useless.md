All human societies have a religion one way or another. There has been no culture on earth that hasn't invented faith based thinking.

We can trace religion to Neanderthals or even to homo erectus.

Religious thinking is embedded in our cognitive process - its a mode of knowing.

Religions are a good mechanism for reducing stress - in explaining things we don't know yet.

We always had morality systems. In large society we enforced it using religions. Because all people can't be watched all the time, we created a concept of god that will do the watching.
