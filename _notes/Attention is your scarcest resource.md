- To be reliably able to focus on something, you need to be intuitively, emotionally invested in the outcome.
- Make sure that you are only ever working on one thing at a time. Even if I got stuck on that one thing.
- Have one obligation to other people.
- Employ a “bullshit timebox”—a one-hour period a few times a week when I do all the things life is too short for.
