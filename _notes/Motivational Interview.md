When trying to change someone's mind on something, try to find their own internal reason to change. This can be done by talking to them - asking open ended questions and listening to understand their reasons. You can do this by asking how they plan to implement their philosophy - this will show them the gaps in their understanding of the situation([[Illusion Of Explanatory Depth]]).

Two types of talking...

- Sustain Talk: Conversation about maintaining the current belief.
- Change Talk: They speak about a desire, ability or commitment to make a change in any aspect - the interviewer listens for this and asks the person to elaborate on that.

Do not use this to manipulate - this requires a true desire to understand people's reasons for their actions/beliefs.
