We tend to favor decisions that continue the status quo. This is because of the comfort of the familiar.

A way to check for this is the Status Quo Test - do a thought experiment which has you already in the unfamiliar state. Eg. Assume you got a job offer with better salary and career options - but you have to move to a city where you don't have friends. You can reverse this as a thought experiment. Think you already have that job - but you got a job over back in your home city with a pay cut - but you can be with friends and family. Would you still take it?

This is a [[Cognitive Bias]]
