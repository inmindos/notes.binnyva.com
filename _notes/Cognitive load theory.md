Different kinds of tasks has different demands on peopleâ€™s working memory. More complex and difficult tasks has higher "cognitive load" and a greater perceived mental effort. There are 3 types of cognitive load..

- **Inherent**: Inherent difficulty of the topic (adding 2+2 vs. solving a differential equation)
- **Extraneous**: The format of learning materials (showing a picture of a square vs. explain it verbally)
- **Germane**: Effort creating a permanent store of knowledge (such as notes, outlines, diagrams etc)

To learn easier...

- **Reducing** inherent load by splitting the information into small parts which can be learned in isolation, and then reassembled into a full picture.
- **Redirecting** extraneous load into germane load (i.e. focusing learner's attention on the construction of *permanent stores of knowledge* - [[Zettelkasten]] is a good way of doing this)
