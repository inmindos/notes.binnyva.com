This refers to how we believe where the power in our life lies.

- External locus of control - if we think that everything in our life was the result of others or external events. We are just going along with the flow.
- Internal locus of control - If we believe that we are driving our lives. We are actively steering.

This is not a binary - but rather a gradient scale.
