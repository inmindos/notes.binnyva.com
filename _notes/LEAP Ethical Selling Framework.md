Ethical selling framework for purpose driven entrepreneurs

Framework is based on...

- Empathy
- Integrity
- Ethics

## Listen > Explain > Ask = Profit

Solves these problems...

- Not making enough money
- Conversion rate is not good enough
- I don't like selling

### Listen

Have an explorer attitude. Try to understand what's going on.

This section has 3 parts...

- Questions you ask
- Answers you get
- Meaning you assign to the answers.

Be careful of the meaning you assign. [[Confirmation Bias]] might be at work making you hear what you want to hear.

If done correctly, you'll get **Permission** to continue.

### Explain

- What the solution IS
- What the solution IS NOT
- What the solution IS FOR
- What the solution IS NOT FOR

The NOT parts will build trust in you. Once you have **Trust**, you can continue to the ask

### Ask

Have an attitude of being there to help someone make a decision - be it an yes or a no.

In this section you are trying to create a shared vision.

The goal is **Enrollment** - we want the buyer to enroll themselves.

You should make **No** an option to them. "Its ok if your answer is no".

If done correctly, this will **Open** the relation to move to the next stage.
