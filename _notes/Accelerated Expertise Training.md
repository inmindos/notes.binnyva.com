Accelerated Expertise is 'taking the concept of skill development to the limit'.

1. Identify the domain Experts
	- In-depth interviews
	- Professional certificates, licensing, etc
	- Performance at similar tasks
	- Ask a groups of practitioners who is a master at what.
2. Extract expertise thru Cognitive Task Analysis
3. Build case library of difficult cases - include the difficultly level in the cases.
4. Make training simulations from the difficult cases
5. 2 types of training programs
	1. Do [[Sense Making]] by themselves - introspect/reflect by themselves
	2. Get feedback from an expert
6. Concepts/principles shown in the training should be emphasized thru the simulation
7. Test - run the simulations with your learners
8. Feedback system during simulations - let learners compare their answers to experts answers.

The theories used to create this process are...

- [[Cognitive Flexibility Theory]]
- [[Cognitive Transformation Theory]]
