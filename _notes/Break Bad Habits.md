Behaviors have a surface level craving and a deeper motivation. Habits are current solutions to evolutionary problems.

You'll have to intentionally highlight negatives of a bad habit to overcome the short term advantage that you are unintentionally looking for.

The process of breaking bad habits is the inverse of [[Four Laws of Behavior Change]]...

### 1. Cue: Make it Invisible

- **Reduce exposure**: Remove triggers from the environment.

### 2. Craving: Make it Unattractive

- Reframe your mindset to highlight benefits of avoiding the bad habits.

### 3. Response: Make it Difficult

- **Increase friction**: Increasing the number of steps.
- **Commitment device**: Restrict your future choices to only those that benefit you

### 4. Reward: Make it Unsatisfying

- **Accountability partner**: Ask someone to monitor your behavior
- **Habit Contract**: Make the cost of bad habits public and painful.
