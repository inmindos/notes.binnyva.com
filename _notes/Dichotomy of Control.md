This is a concept in [[Stoicism]]. In its simplest form...

1. Everything is either within our control or outside our control.
2. Only things within our control are our actions, our emotions, etc.
3. We don't control most other things - not how other people behave or what they think of us.
4. If we want to be happy, focus on things in our control - and don't expect much from things outside our control.

This belief will push you to the external [[Locus of Control]].
