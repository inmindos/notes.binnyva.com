This is part of the [[PARA]] method of [[Personal Knowledge Management]].

## Capture

> Brain is for having ideas, not storing them.

Have a calendar, todo list and a note taking app easily accessible so that when ever you have something that needs captured, it goes into that. 

Make sure you capture anything that resonates with you.

## Organize

PARA says that you have to organize by actionability. Put the information into the project that will need it.

## Distill

Highlight important information. Use [[Progressive Summarization]].

## Express

Create content. Use the knowledge in some way. Ideally in a public way.
