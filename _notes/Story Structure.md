Kurt Vonnegut: All Stories share a collection of similar shapes - that can be shown by plotting the story on an axis of the good vs bad fortune of the protagonist.

- Rags to Riches (rise)
- Riches to Rags (fall)
- Man in a Hole (fall then rise)
- Icarus (rise then fall)
- Cinderella (rise then fall then rise)
- Oedipus (fall then rise then fall)
