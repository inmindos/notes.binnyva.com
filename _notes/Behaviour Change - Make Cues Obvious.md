Law 1 of Behavior Change in [[Atomic Habits]].

To change a behavior, you must know it well. Know the cues, rewards, reason for the behavior/habit. One way of doing this is to call it out every time it happens.

The most common cues for habits are **time and location**. You can use this to create a "implementation intention" - "I will BEHAVIOUR at TIME in LOCATION".

Another method is "Habit Stacking" - "I will NEW HABIT after EXISTING HABIT".

Over time habits becomes associated with the context more than just a single cue. Context becomes the cue. Building new habits will be easier in a new environment because its a new context.

Best way to avoid bad behavior is to make the cue invisible. Rather than having self control, avoid the temptation.
