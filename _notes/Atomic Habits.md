Habits are small actions repeated many times - enough to become automatic. It is the compound interest of our behavior. They can be good or bad.

The main purpose of habits is to solve problems we have with the least energy or effort.

To use the power of habits, focus on your systems rather than your goals. Build your environment(system) that enables good habits and discourages bad ones.

## Levels of Change

- Outcome Change - focus on what you want
- Process Change - focus on how to do the work
- Identity Change - focus on who you want to be. This is the best option.

Your identity will change based on your actions. Every time you do a habit its a vote towards a new identity - be it good or bad.
